# Playwright CLI Skill

Drive a real browser from the terminal using `playwright-cli`.
Treat this skill as CLI-first automation. Do not pivot to `@playwright/test` unless the user explicitly asks for test files.

## Playwright CLI path (required)

This skill expects `playwright-cli` to be available at a fixed path placeholder:

```bash
export PWCLI="##PLAYWRIGHT-CLI##"
```

- `##PLAYWRIGHT-CLI##` must be replaced during installation/deployment.
- Always run commands through `$PWCLI`.

## Prerequisite check (required)

Before proposing any workflow, verify the configured CLI exists and is executable:

```bash
export PWCLI="##PLAYWRIGHT-CLI##"
[ -x "$PWCLI" ]
```

If it is not executable, pause and ask the user to install/configure Playwright CLI at the configured path, then retry.

## Quick start

```bash
export PWCLI="##PLAYWRIGHT-CLI##"
"$PWCLI" open https://playwright.dev --headed
"$PWCLI" snapshot
"$PWCLI" click e15
"$PWCLI" type "Playwright"
"$PWCLI" press Enter
"$PWCLI" screenshot
```

## Core workflow

1. Open the page.
2. Snapshot to get stable element refs.
3. Interact using refs from the latest snapshot.
4. Re-snapshot after navigation or significant DOM changes.
5. Capture artifacts (screenshot, pdf, traces) when useful.

Minimal loop:

```bash
export PWCLI="##PLAYWRIGHT-CLI##"
"$PWCLI" open https://example.com
"$PWCLI" snapshot
"$PWCLI" click e3
"$PWCLI" snapshot
```

## When to snapshot again

Snapshot again after:

- navigation
- clicking elements that change the UI substantially
- opening/closing modals or menus
- tab switches

Refs can go stale. When a command fails due to a missing ref, snapshot again.

## Recommended patterns

### Form fill and submit

```bash
export PWCLI="##PLAYWRIGHT-CLI##"
"$PWCLI" open https://example.com/form
"$PWCLI" snapshot
"$PWCLI" fill e1 "user@example.com"
"$PWCLI" fill e2 "password123"
"$PWCLI" click e3
"$PWCLI" snapshot
```

### Debug a UI flow with traces

```bash
export PWCLI="##PLAYWRIGHT-CLI##"
"$PWCLI" open https://example.com --headed
"$PWCLI" tracing-start
# ...interactions...
"$PWCLI" tracing-stop
```

### Multi-tab work

```bash
export PWCLI="##PLAYWRIGHT-CLI##"
"$PWCLI" tab-new https://example.com
"$PWCLI" tab-list
"$PWCLI" tab-select 0
"$PWCLI" snapshot
```

## References

Open only what you need:

- CLI command reference: `references/cli.md`
- Practical workflows and troubleshooting: `references/workflows.md`

## Guardrails

- Always snapshot before referencing element ids like `e12`.
- Re-snapshot when refs seem stale.
- Prefer explicit commands over `eval` and `run-code` unless needed.
- When you do not have a fresh snapshot, use placeholder refs like `eX` and say why; do not bypass refs with `run-code`.
- Use `--headed` when a visual check will help.
- When capturing artifacts in this repo, use `output/playwright/` and avoid introducing new top-level artifact folders.
- Default to CLI commands and workflows, not Playwright test specs.
